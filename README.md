## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - React framework

### What I learned

This is the first React project I have worked on in almost a year. Working on this small project has helped me refresh my frontend skills using React and CSS. I learned how to spin up a Vite project and then publish it live using Github Pages.

### Continued development

I would like to use more tools within React, like styled components, typescript, and more.

### Useful resources

- [Github Community Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/61478) - This helped me solve the issue I was having when trying to deploy my project to Github Pages.
